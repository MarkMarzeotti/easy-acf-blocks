# Easy ACF Blocks

This WordPress plugins goal is to make setting up Gutenberg blocks using ACF even easier. 

The plugin will look inside the active theme and plugin for a folder at the root called `acf-blocks`. If it is found, it will look for individual blocks in these folders. 

There are examples of commonly used blocks in this plugin. Copy the `example-blocks` folder into your theme folder and rename to `acf-blocks` to see how easy it is to build new blocks using Easy ACF Blocks.
